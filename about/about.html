                    Created by VMA students, Vmawalk is the only public platform for VMA course and teacher ratings.
                    Vmawalk is developed for VMA students to search whether a course or a teacher in VMA is suitable for
                    him or her to take. By viewing experienced students’ reviews, VMA students can know the ratings of
                    satisfaction, easiness, workload, clarity, and helpfulness of a specific course or teacher, and
                    receive inspiring suggestions from past reviews. The goal of Vmawalk is to help all VMAers find a
                    course plan that best suits for oneself, and help all VMAers to become global citizens and leaders
                    with Chinese identity. Welcome to Vmawalk, and enjoy!
