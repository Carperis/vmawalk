                    Vmawalk is operated by VMA students. It takes its name from VMA Walk, the main campus
                    thoroughfare VMA students use to walk to class each day. Vmawalk is run for students, by
                    students, and features anonymous professor reviews and reviews of apartments
                    near VMA. Its goal is to supplement the VMA’s mission of creating a comprehensive record of life
                    at VMA by allowing students to share reviews and advice about academics and housing.
