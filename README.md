Created by VMA students, Vmawalk is the only public platform for VMA course and teacher ratings. 
Vmawalk is developed for VMA students to search whether a course or a teacher in VMA is suitable for him or her to take. 
By viewing experienced students’ reviews, VMA students can know the ratings of satisfaction, easiness, workload, clarity, and helpfulness of a specific course or teacher, and receive inspiring suggestions from past reviews. 
The goal of Vmawalk is to help all VMAers find a course plan that best suits for oneself, and help all VMAers to become global citizens and leaders with Chinese identity. Welcome to Vmawalk, and enjoy!

通过收集学长学姐的五项打分点评，VMAers可以了解某课程或老师的学生平均打分，并从以往的学生点评中获得有用的选课建议。Vmawalk可以让VMA新生迅速地熟悉梅沙的课程系统并作为选课时的有利参考，免去了一个个询问老师和学长学姐的繁琐，不再让新生在选课时感到迷茫地毫无方向。Vmawalk的目标是为了帮助所有VMAers找到最适合自己的课程规划，也是为了提升VMA的老师课程系统的展示方式，以更好公开地帮助梅沙课程系统的完善和未来发展。
