# vmawalk

## Intro
Created by Vanke Meisha Academy (VMA) students, Vmawalk is the only public platform for VMA course and teacher ratings. By viewing experienced studentsâ€™ reviews, VMA students can know the ratings of satisfaction, easiness, workload, clarity, and helpfulness of a specific course or teacher, and receive inspiring suggestions from past reviews. The goal of Vmawalk is to help all VMAers find a course plan that best suits for oneself, and help all VMAers to become global citizens and leaders with Chinese identity. Welcome to Vmawalk, and enjoy!
